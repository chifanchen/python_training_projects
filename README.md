CaculateROI

Well,I'm from China.So nothing to say about my english.
It's written by tkinter(python3.5).I wrote this for studying.

    1.What can it do
    The code is simple.When you execute it, you will see a window which has three button.
    计算:caculate which means caculate the return.
    添加新项目:Add new row,when you click it,you will see some Entry,you can insert the money and rate for caculate.
    保存:when you click on it,the script will create a "data.txt" to save the results.
    2.the meaning of Labels:
    项目名称：the name of yuor investment
    投资金额：the money that you invest
    年化利率：the rate of return for one year
    日收益 ：the return of investment each day

So I wish someone would read the code and give some suggestions.It's really cool and it's the meaning of sharing.
